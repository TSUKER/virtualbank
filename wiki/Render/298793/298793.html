<div class="wikidoc"><b>Project Description</b><br />Virtual bank is a simple web-based budgeting and finance system. It&#39;s developed in C&#35; and ASP.NET 4.0. I created it because I wanted a solution that was geared specifically for my own needs and not too complicated.<br /><br />The Virtual Bank project is a simple web application that I thought up after working with one after another complicated and confusing applications for managing my finances. It&#39;s not automatic, and it doesn&#39;t connect to any banking systems; the whole point of the project is to be simple and easy to use. Once I&#39;m finished with the version I&#39;m hoping that my budgeting will work out a lot better! :-)</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
